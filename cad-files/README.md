These are all the files for the latest version of bento. I've designed it so it can be printed on something as small as a BambuLabs A1 Mini.

if you decide to build your own you'll need:

* Steam Deck parts:
  * Main board (can be found on ebay or extracted from a donor deck)
  * [Heatsink](https://www.ifixit.com/products/steam-deck-oled-heat-sink) & [fan](https://www.ifixit.com/products/steam-deck-oled-fan)
  * [Battery](https://www.ifixit.com/products/steam-deck-oled-battery)
  * [Screws](https://www.amazon.com/Deal4GO-Philips-replacement-Steam-Deck-Internal/dp/B0CTPN7MYG/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1D9380HA48KKX&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.NavxaBLKsqqJ0gCh_Qcn6j7ehbRqrgOODfLx0FGPkAQLeqtjAH2f-53tK-vFnLe3agBS4hYCgR9McXSpRxcLzSkHJvon3ALPZ3uAnwDZwF03z34HE3W7Cc1Qo4IBibP4.qCtxedHL0H-b-sjiVU4ZWUGGb4E-sBFoOfQ2w8nZvOQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=steam+deck+oled+screws&qid=1750028387&sprefix=steam+deck+screws%2Caps%2C213&sr=8-3)
